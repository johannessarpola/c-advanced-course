AMID THE WHISPERING TREES, A FORGOTTEN PATH BECKONED,
ITS COBBLESTONES BATHED IN THE DAPPLED GLOW OF TWILIGHT.
A LONE WANDERER TRACED THE ANCIENT ROUTE, FOOTSTEPS
A SOFT RHYTHM AGAINST THE TAPESTRY OF FALLEN LEAVES.

THE AIR HELD THE PROMISE OF FORGOTTEN STORIES, SECRETS
WOVEN INTO THE DELICATE THREADS OF NATURE'S EMBRACE.
EACH STEP UNVEILED THE PAST—A WEATHERED WELL, A CRUMBLING
ARCHWAY—WHISPERING OF LIVES THAT ONCE FLOURISHED HERE.

IN THIS DANCE BETWEEN TIME'S GENTLE CURRENTS AND THE SEEKER'S
QUIET YEARNING, THE PAST AND PRESENT CONVERGED, PAINTING
FLEETING PORTRAITS IN THE CANVAS OF MEMORY.
